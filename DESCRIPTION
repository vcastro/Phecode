Description: Phecode is a lightweight package containing the most recent 
    Phecode definitions and their mappings to ICD-9 and ICD-10 as published
    in the Vanderbilt PheWAS catalog \url{}.  Use these data to group 
    ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes from EHR data to PheCodes for PheWAS or other 
    analyses.  The PheWAS R package (\url{https://github.com/PheWAS/PheWAS}) 
    provides additional functionality but this data is meant for easier use
    and maintenance of Phecodes.
