Description: Phecode is a lightweight package containing the most recent 
    Phecode definitions and their mappings to ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes as 
    published in the Vanderbilt PheWAS catalog 
    \url{https://phewascatalog.org/}. Use these data to group ICD-9 and 
    ICD-10 diagnoses codes from EHR data to PheCodes for PheWAS or other 
    analyses.  The PheWAS R package (\url{https://github.com/PheWAS/PheWAS}) 
    provides additional functionality for running analysis.  This package is 
    meant for easier use and maintenance of Phecodes.
